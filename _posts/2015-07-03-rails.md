## Great Rails Resources

----------

My job doesn't really involve ruby, and I've been wanting to give rails a whirl for a while. Thought I'd take the July 4th weekend and try it and jot down resources I've come across.

Installation:
Really great write up on rails install using brew [Rails Install OS X](http://guides.railsgirls.com/install/#setup-for-os-x
)

Deployment:
Heroku is the way to go

Gotchas:
I did have to upgrade my current ruby and rails installation to be compatible with the example app on heroku
```
  sudo gem update --system
```

Also, it's nice to periodically run clean
```
sudo bundle clean
```
