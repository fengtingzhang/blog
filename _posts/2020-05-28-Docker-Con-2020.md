## Docker Con 2020

----------

### Getting Started With Docker
The story of never-ending installation & configuration and docker to the rescue

#### Why Docker?
1. Individual machines and operating systems need to be configured and upgraded. On top of that infrastructure, runs the application code

2. Machine configuration and upgrades are extremely error prone, servers were missed or misconfigured

#### Containers
Docker containers to the rescue

* A docker container composes of
```
base image
+
your application code
```

* This composition creates your application docker image.

* When one of the images has a problem, you don't have to shut down the entire server. Instead, you can fix the infrastructure or the application layer, build a new image, and deploy the image to that server, run it,  ship it, and retire the buggy image.

#### Writing Dockerfile
FROM - tells docker to pull down the base image
WORKDIR - the directory where your application lives
ENV - the environment variables in your image


#### Building a docker container
```
$ docker build --help
$ docker build --tag <tag name> <path to the directory to build>
```
This builds an image called `hello-world` using the current directory

#### Running a docker container
```
$ docker run --help
$ docker run <name of the image>
```
