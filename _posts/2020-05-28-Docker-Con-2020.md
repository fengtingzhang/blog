## Docker Con 2020

----------

### Getting Started With Docker
The story of never-ending installation & configuration and docker to the rescue

#### Why Docker?
1. Individual machines and operating systems need to be configured and upgraded. On top of that infrastructure, runs the application code

2. Machine configuration and upgrades are extremely error prone, servers were missed or misconfigured

#### Containers
Docker containers to the rescue

* A docker container composes of
```
base image
+
your application code
```

* This composition creates your application docker image.

* When one of the images has a problem, you don't have to shut down the entire server. Instead, you can fix the infrastructure or the application layer, build a new image, and deploy the image to that server, run it,  ship it, and retire the buggy image.

#### Writing Dockerfile
```
FROM - tells docker to pull down the base image
WORKDIR - the directory where your application lives
ENV - the environment variables in your image
```

#### Building a docker container
```
$ docker build --help
$ docker build --tag <tag name> <path to the directory to build>
```
This builds an image called `hello-world` using the current directory

#### Listing docker images
```
$ docker images
```

#### Running a docker container
A container is a process that's isolated from the rest of the system. By default, your container is run in isolation:
* It has its own file system and its own network
* It's restricted in CPU and memory usage

```
$ docker run --help
$ docker run <name of the image>
```

If you don't map out a port, and connect it to any network, in the browser when you connect to it, you won't be able to connect.

Diagnostics - to see if anything is running

List any running image
```
$ docker ps
```

List any image that was previously run, but has stopped
```
$ docker ps -a
```
