## Docker Con 2020

----------

### Getting Started With Docker
The story of never-ending installation & configuration and docker to the rescue

#### Why Docker?
1. Individual machines and operation systems need to be configured and upgraded. On top of that infrastructure, runs the application code

2. Machine configuration and upgrades are extremely error prone, servers were missed or misconfigured

#### Containers
- Build Images
- Ship Images
- Run Images

#### Install Docker


#### Write Dockerfile
