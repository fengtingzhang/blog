## My Routine Meal Prep Recipes

----------

In our busy schedules, it's difficult to carve out slithers of time between meetings to cook during the week. We started dedicating a block of time weekends and off-hours mid-week, to batch-cook ingredients for the week ahead. It's not an one-sized solution for everyone, but has been working for us these past weeks.

- marinate cauliflower florets with `soy sauce`, `paprika`
