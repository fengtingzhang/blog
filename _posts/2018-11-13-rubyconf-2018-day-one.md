## Ruby Conf 2018 Day One

----------


## Opening Key note by Matz - The Power of The Community

### Programming languages

* In early 1980s the BASIC programming language was limited, I didn't know any other language, I felt so frustrated by the limitations of BASICS
* PASCAL compiler was expensive so I didn't compile but just read through the book - designed to be teaching language
* C was designed to replace Assembly, so those languages were designed with clear intentions
* Programming language is a form of expressing human ideas

#### History
* I made it for fun, I didn't try to make any money out of it.
* Why not me? This was my teenage dream, and then I went to college and majored in Computer Science.
* 1993 I started developing Ruby with 1 user
* 1995 Ruby mailing list was formed with 200 users, report bugs and gave me suggestions - it predated the concept of open source in 1998, we didn't have a term for it so we called them free software
* 2000 The Pickaxe Book - Total nuber of users, 10000 users?
* 2001 First Ruby Conf held in Tampa, Florida - 34 Attendees
...
* 2018 Estimated Number of Users Over 1M+


#### 2018
* Businesses use Ruby
* DevOps use Ruby, Chef
* Embedded Programming people
* Robots, payments devices, micro satellites
* Web Servers (ngx_mruby, h2o)
* You

#### Community
* We are the community, there is no registration, or membership
* Everyone uses Javascript here, we are not exclusive
* Like Typhoon - We see Wind, Rain and Low Pressure; A vague structure, we cannot touch, move, or delete the typhoon. But comes with a huge power.
