## Ruby Conf 2018 Day One

----------


## Opening Key note by Matz - The Power of The Community

### Programming languages

* In early 1980s the BASIC programming language was limited, I didn't know any other language, I felt so frustrated by the limitations of BASICS
* PASCAL compiler was expensive so I didn't compile but just read through the book - designed to be teaching language
* C was designed to replace Assembly, so those languages were designed with clear intentions
* Programming language is a form of expressing human ideas

#### History
* I made it for fun, I didn't try to make any money out of it.
* Why not me? This was my teenage dream, and then I went to college and majored in Computer Science.
* 1993 I started developing Ruby with 1 user
* 1995 Ruby mailing list was formed with 200 users, report bugs and gave me suggestions - it predated the concept of open source in 1998, we didn't have a term for it so we called them free software
* 2000 The Pickaxe Book - Total nuber of users, 10000 users?
* 2001 First Ruby Conf held in Tampa, Florida - 34 Attendees
...
* 2018 Estimated Number of Users Over 1M+

#### 2018
* Businesses use Ruby
* DevOps use Ruby, Chef
* Embedded Programming people
* Robots, payments devices, micro satellites
* Web Servers (ngx_mruby, h2o)
* You

#### Community
* We are the community, there is no registration, or membership
* Everyone uses Javascript here, we are not exclusive
* Like Typhoon - We see Wind, Rain and Low Pressure; A vague structure, we cannot touch, move, or delete the typhoon. But comes with a huge power.
* Ruby cannot be Ruby without its community


#### Bug reports and Community Contributions
* I was not a great programmer and created many bugs
* We owe much to the community
* Intellectual curiosity

#### Features from community contributions
* I was not the one that came up with these ideas
* UTF-8
* Enumerator
* Generational GC
* Keyword Args
* Types
* JIT
* Concurrency

#### Feeding the community
* I created the shell and put it on the internet, but it's not where the value is
* Ruby the community is the value
* Comfortable
* Intellectual Challenge
* We (the core members) need to feed the community, like feeding a shark
# Are we losing the members

#### Hype cycle
![Hype cycle](https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/research/images/illustrations/researchmethodology-illustration-hype-cycle.jpg "Hype cycle")

* People love new and shiny things
* Ruby is grown up, but if we're in the trough in the cycle then it's where people should invest
* We must *NOT* be fragile in our choice

#### Ruby's role in twitter development
* Ruby helped to form twitter Ruby 1.8
* We implemented the new Ruby virtual machine after that, and made it feature rich
* Not perl
* Ruby was slow in 1.8 but has gotten faster
* We had other languages in the 90s and they went away because they gave up
* The best way for survival - Policy and Philosophy - Never give up, be nice and be happy, form positive feedback loops, hire developments, great tools & libraries. out of comfort zone, try new things and make new friends

#### You do your part
* Blog, tweet, share share your ideas, it will be a drop of water and it will form a ocean. You do your part and we will do our part

#### We are working on Ruby 3
* Performance
* Concurrency
* Code Analysis
* Tools
* Endless-range
* JIT (experiment)
* Proc_call
* Transient heap
* Pattern matching
* Sane keyword arguments

### Ruby 2.6

### Future
* The creator of python has retired
* 2025 Ruby 4 - practice for the future
* Test-be for new design process

## The games developers play - Andy Caroll

#### Psychology
* Games People Play by Eric Berne

#### Roles
* Parent
* Adult
* Child

* Perpetrator, Rescuer, and Victim
* I'm not a victim
* Code review

## Designing Engineering Teams

### Just hire great engineers
* You can't just hire great engineers
* Engineers have different kinds of backgrounds, a traditional CS background, bootcamp, languages
* Growth isn't linear, people grow unique, interesting sets of skills

### The Venn diagram of You and them
* People want to work with people who are exactly like them, but if there's a 100% overlap between YOU and THEM, then one of you is redundant
* The best candidates are people are have some overlap with you but bring a lot to the team from their non-overlaps
* The field is vast, nobody knows even 10% of software

### A digression into the history of aviation
#### Fatal airline accidents per year 1946-2017 decreased because they figured out
1. what do you need to do to make flying safe
1. who are the people you need
1. how do you train them

### A digression into the history of medicine
1. division of responsibilities and roles
1. teaching hospitals

"Let's rewrite this patient in React"

### You need a variety of skills
* People leadership
* Technical leadership
* Customer focus and metrics
* Students (students with newer knowledge and questions helps teams)
