## Ruby Conf 2018 Day Three

----------

## Key note - UNLEARNING - THE CHALLENGE OF CHANGE by Jessie Shternshus
* Why does it take a child 3 weeks to learn how to ride a backwards bike? Why is it so much harder for an adult?
* It's easier for a child to unlearn

### Your brain on unlearning
* Learning a new keyboard
# Learning a new language

### Adapt
* Unlearn the way that we do things - companies that no longer exist: Toys'R Us, Blockbuster, Kodak
* Unlearn the org chart

### How do you motivate your team to change?
* Surface the resistance
* Hear what they have to say
* Identify the value for them to change
* Unlearning is hard & empathy is required

### How do we make it better?
* Change those habits and mindsets
* Bring an outside's perspective
* Perform escape thinking challenge
* Conduct unlearning reviews - what have you let go of in the last 6 months that provided more room for something new?

### Case study
* Last year I was working with a big food company figuring out how solve the problem of food waste from the farm to the consumer
* The company started an internship program where junior high school students went to the lab and provided a different perspective
* We need curiosity to innovate

### Books
* CTRL-SHIFT Paperback by Mike Bonifer
