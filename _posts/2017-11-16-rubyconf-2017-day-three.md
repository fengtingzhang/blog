## Ruby Conf 2017 Day Three

----------

## You insufficiently persuasive by Sandi Metz

### Happiness
* Recent study `On the Unhappiness of Software Developers`
* 456,293 emails
* ~100 responded
* 219 unhappiness codes

### Top external problems
1. Time pressure
1. Bad code quality and coding practice
1. Unexplained broken code
1. Bad decision making
1. Imposing limitation on development

### Persuasion
#### Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by Robert B. Cialdini
1. Reciprocity
  * Hare Krishnas
  * Evolutionary tendency to form groups, and the expectation that when you give up something you will receive something bigger in return

2. Consistency
  * you promised, a child's expectations for a toy

3. Social Proof
  * follow what other people do
  * being ostricized for doing something that isn't the norm

4. Authority

5. Liking
  * tend to like people who are similar to us
  * tend to like people who we have interacted well with in the past
  * trust
  * you understand that you're bound implicitly by obligiations that you don't want to fulfill

6. Scarcity
  * the value of things go up when there are fewer things
  * that's why Amazon tells you only 7 items of something are left
  * the more value you place on something the more unwiling people are unwilling to let it go, for example a parking space

#### How to Win Friends & Influence People by Dale Carnegie
Carnegie's book is about changing you, if you want to persuade people you should do that by changing the way you behave
I like it much better than the weaponized way that Cialdini has

### How do you know you're right?
Ends vs Means, the arguments are not about the ends but about how you do them
People aren't inherently evil, they have the same lofty goals abut disagree about how to get there.
If you understand motivation you will be better forged to gain agreements.

#### Drive by Daniel H. Pink
* if the task are mechanical - higher pay leads to higher performance
* when the tasks become creative, if you need conceptual mode of thinking - higher pay leads to lower performance

as soon as pay becomes sufficient, other motivations become relevant
1. autonomy
1. drive to mastery
1. purpose

teamwork
* collaborating
* studies show teams innovate faster
* they achieve higher job satisfaction
* instead of asking how can we be more persuasive we should ask how can we make better teams


#### Project Aristole by Google
They could not find patterns based on teams
They knew things that don't matter, for example personality
Group can have identities that were different from the identity from the individual

#### Psycholoical safety
* The fundamental thing that differentiate high performing team to dysfunctional ones are how the members of the team speak and treat each other. Group culture where everyone feels comfortable to speak

Equality in distrubtion of conversational turn-taking
- as long as everyone spoke in turn the team did well, if a few individuals spoke roughly all the time it

* Average social sensitivity
- seeing how each other feels

A culture of accountability and clear goals are also important but psychological safety is the most important trait

#### Other suggestions
* have strong opinions but weakly held
* have an identity but keep it small
