## strict object type checking and reuse, an alternative to REST

----------

Been knee deep in react lately, and went to another talk given at Facebook about graphql and relay - its implementation of flux. It's interesting to look at some of these features compared to our implementation, which uses dropwizard, typesafe, react, and redux (flux).

Motivations

1. More than simple and custom endpoints
2. Request and response are the same shape
3. Arbitrarily deep
4. Mental model for product developers


Type system
Type Query {
  Me: user
}

Type user {
  Name: String
  Another: foo
}

All the way down

1. App server adverse what's available, UI client request the shape that it wants
2. Manages complexities of 52 weekly release to iOS and hit fixes in between, also multiple products so 1000s backward compatibility


Compositions an decomposition
Fragment friend fragment on User {
Name
Events {
Name
}
}


Not a storage engine, query language over the application code

Centralize complexity, promise API
GraphQL sever advterises schema
_schema object

Example against
Swapi api

GraphQL server
Type system plus sever - interacts with rest server

GraphQL editor, syntax checking evaluate graphQL  and then code generate from the rest calls


Other Facebook products
with relay externalize
With react native native apps

Specifications
RFC specification
Express-graphql
In 4 months it will be back ported into Facebook

Other Open source products
Graphql-ruby
Graphql-Java
Rx

React
Functional programming
Immutable data structure
Declarative API
Opinionated platform
Learn once and write anywhere, js, Java, hack

React native for iOS and android
Relay horizontal platform to interact with react and graphql


Q&A
Deprecation
Add manufactured field and manufactured connection and deprecate a field


Bias toward one mega schema. The entire Facebook app is built on one schema.


Backend developer map out types and turn into GraphQL type designers

persistent queries in the serverside

It doesn't support aggregations
1. Intentionally leaving out
2. Can add fields to add aggregations to opt in backend and middle tier developers to advertise this

Graph sever orchestration
Direct externalizations of
M query
Antonette query?

Mapping
Class and field types to backend

Centralized mutations
