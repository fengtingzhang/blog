<h2 id="features-of-systemd">Features of systemd</h2>

<hr />

<p>Recently went to a talk given at Facebook by Lennart Poettering. Systemd will be replacing sysvinit in the upcoming REL 7 distribution in Red Hat Linux, the Linux operating system that is commonly used in some enterprises. What interests me are the container features that it provides as an alternative to the docker style container system. </p>

<p>Started in 2009
Before systemd
sysvinit
- no dependency management
- code is not very clean</p>

<p>Upstart
- code is clean
- glue
- defining a lot of events and glue them together
- maximize what gets started at system startup</p>

<p>Instead of admin explicitly defining what happens when, up to the system to figure out what to start
- job of the developer/admin to define dependencies and job of the system/computer to take care of the rest. Philosophy is that the computer to solve the algorithm for you.</p>

<p>Inspirations from
1. Launchd
Socket activation
Inetd</p>

<ol>
  <li>SMF
Solaris management framework</li>
</ol>

<p>Features of Systemd
1. Modular
An turn off most except 3</p>

<p>Basic concepts</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Everything is a unit
Foo.service
Bar.device
Waldo.target
Another.socket
Something.automount</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dependencies (-&gt; requires)
Multi-user.target -&gt; http.service -&gt; basic.target -&gt; local-fs.target -&gt; home.mount -&gt; Systemd-fsck@dev-sda6.service -&gt; dev-sda7.device</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Run level vs linear dependency
Descriptive targets (you can define and name the targets)
Start as a little as necessary, parallel as much as possible.</p>

<p>This example above is a dependency check for a web (http service).</p>

<p>System graph to see dependencies</p>

<p>Example of parent and child process double forking (the classic example)
- example if Apache needs MySQL to be started first
systemd tracks processes using the Linux kernel’s cgroups subsystem instead of by using process identifiers (PIDs); thus, daemons cannot “escape” systemd, not even by double-forking.</p>

<p>Starting a service at service level 3</p>

<p>Systemctl stop service
Systemctl restart
Systemctl status
- will show you the entire tree
- how long ago was the service started
Systemctl show
- shows status for processes</p>

<p>Systemctl cat (don’t have to go to the directory file/folder)
Systemctl edit - tell MySQL to change the cpu to use</p>

<p>More daemons
Systemd-udevd</p>

<p>Systemd-logind
Systemd-journald
- admin can </p>

<p>Systemd-networkd
- network manager
- match to which configuration does his network file match
- Intel uses it to do router configurations for example
Uplink and downlink management
Networks are fully hotswappable
- does not do wifi</p>

<p>Systemd-resolved
- DNS on red hat vs DNS on your local home
- if we have information about queries then we won’t query all that we know.</p>

<p>Systemd-timesyncd
- syncs the clock
- when the system comes up if the clock comes up empty (ex: on raspberry pi) the time stamp might not be monotonic
-recommended over full ntp server if http is not needed</p>

<p>Systemd-locald
Systemd-hostnamed</p>

<p>Others for bootup
Systemd-tmpfiles
- setup up sync remove and setup temp/files at boot time</p>

<p>Systemd-sysusers
- bootup a system with just the users around
- will not create etc and var until necessary
- especially useful for container based systems that just only need users, where most container information is stored in a MySQL database</p>

<ul>
  <li>useful for rpm also</li>
</ul>

<p>System-module-load</p>

<p>Systemd-binfmt
Format binaries such as Java</p>

<p>Systemd-backlight
Manages background lighting actors reboot</p>

<p>Systemd-random-seed
Saves randomness seed across reboot</p>

<p>Journalctl
Log error, really useful, time zone correctly - unlike syslog, or chroot which is a steam</p>

<p>Systemctl</p>

<p>Loginctl
Show session
Show user log</p>

<p>Machinectl
Useful for containers</p>

<p>Coredumpctl
Collects core dumps
Ex: coredumpctl gdb
If used this way every coredump is logged</p>

<p>Busctl
What interfaces methods and dbus messages each message offer</p>

<p>Systemd-nspawn
- container runs over this (docker has its own implementation), rkt is built on it
- simple
- spawn it to a directory and start it up
- like qemu-Kvm but for containers</p>

<p>Systemd-machined
- rest of the system knows about what a container is
- nspawn will register
- place to register containers (don’t emulate Hardware but share kernel) and VM (emulate hardware)
- every container registered with machined will get host name resolutions
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/machined/
- dash M flag
- machinectl status
- like Unix ps command allows state of container</p>

<p>Via machined
Ps
Systemctl -M
In this container very thing is okay or 5 failed
Loginctl -M who is logged in within this container
Systemctl list-containers</p>

<p>Container
Nspawn</p>

<p>VM
Kvm</p>

<p>Systemd-import
Uncompressed/unzip and then call nspawn
Add more containers (and VMs) to your local system</p>

<p>Nspawn va docker
Docker’s philosophy
- micro service within each docker</p>

<p>Systemd
- difference between systemd and normal container should be minimal
More integrated isolation
Recursively entering into the docker is annoying
Journalctl example can interleave all service logs into one log stream</p>

<p>Summary
See image</p>

<p>Q&amp;A
1 how do you deal with trolls
Cost of open source</p>

<p>2 tools are tightly bundled
- networkd makes assumptions about how the system is run
/var
Assumptions that certain mounts and libraries exist
Vendor for the operation system should integrate for you
- it doesn’t run on FreeBSD, Solaris SMF is not inherently portable either. Making it portable is a burden and it’s not a priority for Debian.
- benefits code is more minimal.</p>

<p>If you buy rel 7 (red hat) you should get systemd preconfigured</p>

<p>Nspawn now works on non systemd systems now but it’s not officially supported.</p>

<p>Inotify fix request - reload file from disk every 10 minutes.
- Notify sync
- Unix doesn’t have a transactional file system.
- Snapshot from dbus on disk is non trivial</p>

<p>Opinionated
Syslog flaws, journal log say the earliest and everything is logged
Consolek replaced by logind</p>

<p>Journal-remote
Journal over http protocol., understands ssl</p>

<ul>
  <li>Export to handle coredump (binary) plus json</li>
  <li>provides both push and pull based logging</li>
  <li>pull based in at times useful</li>
</ul>

<p>Claims only 99% compatibility with old style fs
Not sysvinit 100% compatibility</p>
