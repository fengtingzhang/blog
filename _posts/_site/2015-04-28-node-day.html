  <li>
    <p>Microservices mappings entitlements versus authentication in nginx</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Since Jan 2011 the number of node modules has grown exponetially to ~140000 modules</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Isomorphic javascript</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Private repositories where developers can publish modules</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Greenfield outside of startups are rare and enterprises involve legacy migration which is brittle over time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep processes small, week worth of bad code, microservices of node services versus a single monolithic process</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rapid, Less code – value sooner, 2x faster to deliver to java and .net</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>2 year +, once the problem space has been mapped out we can move to scala or go so it can scale better</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="enterprise-adoption-panel-ancestry-fidelity-and-paypal">Enterprise Adoption Panel (ancestry, fidelity, and paypal)</h2>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>At paypal – large private npm reigsry (early adopter), krakenjs can handle large number of hits framework over express, expressive more lines of README than code</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ancestry is a java and .net shop that has been converting over from monolithic microsoft model</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adoption was over time, tested in the UI space first then organically spread but not without resistance. 2x rapid delivery convinced some.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start out small and scale out at ancestry, 5 people week/up to about 50 people out of 120</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support experience at fidelity - first team on node sometimes can get stretched out thin responding to 5 other teams regarding node questions even for well documented libraries like express or yeoman</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Internal open source model at ancestry and fidelity – default public, writing code with the mindset to open souce, external open source model at paypal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Git adaoption - atlassian stash at ancestry and fidelity, github enterprise at paypal (all three companies use git).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Standardardization for documentation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Default public model in repositories (compared to default private model previously which were siloed)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start up small and test out the problem space, go slow to figure it out and then iterate on that</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crack specific types of problems, restify library for converting SOAP</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Know your domain</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Engage the community</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t use node for everything, don’t use it for cryto</p>
