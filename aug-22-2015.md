1. If the universe is finite and filled with inifite stars, why doesn't the sky light up with the light of infinite stars?
- The universe must have started at a finite time, therefore some stars have not formed in time for their lights to have reached us yet
- The universe is expanding and the stars are moving away from us in a speed faster enough to overtake the speed of time 186,000 miles/second - observed by Hubble in 1929
